# Setting up a new project in Medusa

## Setting up a specific site project

1. First select the site you want to add a new project to, if the site does not already exsist then request an admin to create the site for you.
2. Select **New Project**, fill in the details for the project and select **Create New Project**.

TODO: ADD PICTURE

3. You will now see something similar to the screen below, if any details are incorrect or the project is no longer required 
you can either edit or delete the newly created project using the links at the end of the table. If you now click on the project name
it will take you to a detailed dashboard about the project. From here you can view the job number, job comencement date
and how complete the project is (In a new project there are no ITCs therefore completion will be 0%).

4. From this dashboard we can now create a project ITP by clicking on the corresponding link labeled *Create a new Inspection and Test Plan.
As you will see the creation screen is very similar to that of project creation, once you fill in the details press **Create ITP**.
5. This will bring you to the ITP dashboard which includes a list for deliverables and any details for an ITP. To add a deliverable to the
click on the link for deliverables which will bring up the list in a seperate screen and hit **NEW DELIVERABLE**.

TODO: ADD PICTURE

6. In this creation screen you will need to select the type of deliverable and it's location (If these details are not available you 
will need to let an admin know so they can add either a new deliverable type or location). Once created you will see your new deliverable
added to your list (if you click return you will be brought back to the ITP dashboard with all the deliverables shown). Clcicking on the newly
created deliverable will bring you to the deliverable dashboard with all information relevant to the deliverable included. Including who
owns the deliverable, it's completion status (based on the ITCs seen later) and a list of ITCs. 

TODO: ADD PICTURE

7. This list is automatically generated based on the type of deliverable chosen. This list can be changed in the ITC list screen.

TODO: ADD PICTURE

8. The list contains several options to customise the ITCs for a job, first you can add other exsisting ITCs using the **ADD ITC** button which
will take you to a list of ITCs from templates to select from. If you don't see the ITC you want then you can simply create a new ITC with 
the **CREATE A NEW ITC** button which will allow you to generate a new ITC template which is covered later in the documentation. Once again
you have your edit and delete links for each row as well as a new link called *Start testing*. This button will generate all checks associated
with that ITC and place them in a table associated with that specific ITC.

TODO: ADD PICTURE

9. Once testing has been started the user can choose to complete a specific check for that ITC by clicking the completed box then pressing save.
This will fill out the relevant fields in the table with a completion date, completed by and status fields. Once the page has reloaded
you will now see that the check box remains ticked and the percentage complete section at the top will be automatically updated
based on the number of checks completed. If a checkbox is accidentally ticked when saving you can easily remove it by unticking the
box and clicking **SAVE CHANGES**, the completed by and date will be removed however the status box will now say *In progress*.
In addition to this you can also add checks for the ITC if needed, however keep in mind that these changes are currently not 
saved into the templates.

TODO: ADD PICTURE

10. If you return to the ITC list screen you will see that the percentage complete portion of the ITC is automatically updated (all views
should have been updated with the latest completion percentage). If you want to re enter the testing check list you need to click on the 
name link (**WARNING: IF YOU CLICK START TESTING AGAIN THE CHECK LIST WILL BE REGENERATED AND ALL CURRENT PROGRESS WILL BE LOST.**)
