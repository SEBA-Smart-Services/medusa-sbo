### Actions

The next section allows users to assign and release tickets (This may be moved up into the table section at a later date). In addition there is an
action area where a ticket can be closed and given a resolution, and a history of the ticket with details on changes and dates of actions.
If a ticket has been closed it can no longer be assigned, released or edited, to reopen a ticket simply click the **Reopen** button.
(If you click on a name in the actions section you can email the user for any further information.)
